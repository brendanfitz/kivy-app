# packing-list-python-kivy-app

Ugh, packing, #amirite

If you need an application that allows you to create organized packing lists and to track what you have and have not packed, look no further!

I created this application as an opportunity to gain experience with Kivy, one of the most popular python GUI libraries. 

### Command-Line Execution

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Testing

```
python -m unittest tests.test_packing_list
```

Enjoy!
